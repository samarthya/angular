# NgFundamentals

Tryint to learn Angular while creating a tuotrial application with the help of Plural Sight. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Learning so far

* Never use ending commas with the **TSLINT** application. Make sure you **_DO NOT append any COMMAS_** at the end of last lines of any object or statement you are defining in the _tslint.json_
* The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation context for components.
* Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules (related code).
* An app always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.
* Component define view.
* Decorators around the classes provide the metadata used by angular.
* Two types of validators SYNC and ASYNC
* You can then inspect the control's state by exporting ngModel to a local template variable. #myName=ngModel
* Functional programming: programming paradigm where the output of the function is solely dependent on the input values of the function.
* Components and Directives have a life cycle.
* NgOnInit - Angular calls this hook shortly after the component is created.
* Dependency injection - DI - Where a class asks for its dependency from an external provider.
